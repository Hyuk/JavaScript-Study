# Data Structures

* Ways of organizing information with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing records.

* Javascript natively implements several data structures. You will still be asked about 'inferior' data structures.

* Queue - Add Queue - array.unshift()

* Queue - Remove from Queue - array.pop()

Queue | Array Equivalent
--- | ---
Add Queue | array.unshift();
Remove from Queue | array.pop();
