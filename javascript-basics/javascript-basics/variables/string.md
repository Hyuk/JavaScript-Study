# String

### Define String variable with single quotation mark and double quotation mark.
```javascript
let string1 = 'This is a string. 👏';
let string2 = "This is the 2nd string. 💁";

let string3 = "It's six o'clock.";
let string4 = 'Remember to say "please" and "thank you."';

let string5 = 'It\'s six o\'clock.';
let string6 = "Remember to say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"";
```

### Count how many characters in string.
```javascript
"caterpillar".length;

// 11
```

### Convert the string to Lower Case or Upper Case
```javascript
"THE KIDS".toLowerCase();

// the kids

"I wish I were big.".toUpperCase();

// "I WISH I WERE BIG."
```

### Remove whitespace characters
```javascript
"   but keep the middle spaces   ".trim();

// "but keep the middle spaces"
```
